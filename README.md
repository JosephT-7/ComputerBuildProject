# ComputerBuildProject
Computer store to build your own custom PC or Laptop

Class: CSC 160

First major project learing the fundamaentals of Object Oriented Programming. In this project we explored how to create classes and link them together to create a virtual store. 

After reviewing the code there several things I could have done better. Applying a 'back' function would be helpful for the user's end. Adding a 'quit' function so the user can exit the process at anytime would be convenient. Then maybe adding an 'edit' function at the end of the program when all selected products were displayed would be a helpful feature.
